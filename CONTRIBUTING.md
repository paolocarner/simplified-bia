# Contributing to the SMB Business Impact Analysis Template

Thanks for considering contributing! This template exists to help SMBs manage business continuity risk without enterprise-level resources. If you've used it and found ways to make it better, your input is valuable.

## What We're Looking For

**Improvements that make the template:**
- Easier to understand for non-technical business owners
- Faster to complete without sacrificing usefulness
- More practical for resource-constrained teams
- Better aligned with real SMB scenarios

**Examples we'd love to see:**
- Anonymized, completed BIAs showing how real companies used this
- Industry-specific guidance (manufacturing, SaaS, professional services, etc.)
- Additional tips based on your experience
- Translations to other languages

## What We're Not Looking For

**Please don't submit:**
- Enterprise-level complexity that defeats the "good enough" philosophy
- Theoretical frameworks without practical application
- Vendor-specific sales pitches disguised as improvements
- Major structural changes without discussion first

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Found something unclear or incorrect? [Open an issue](../../issues) and include:
- What you were trying to do
- What was confusing or wrong
- How you think it could be better

### Suggesting Improvements

Have an idea for making the template better? [Open an issue](../../issues) to discuss it first. This saves everyone time if the suggestion doesn't fit the project's goals.

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b improve-recovery-section`)
3. **Make your changes** - Keep the conversational, practical tone
4. **Test your changes** - Make sure the template still makes sense end-to-end
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you changed and why

### Writing Style Guidelines

This template uses a specific voice:

**Do:**
- Use plain language - "how long can things be down" not "quantify downtime tolerance"
- Be direct and honest - "If you haven't tested this, you're guessing"
- Include practical examples - Real scenarios over abstract concepts
- Acknowledge constraints - "Good enough beats perfect"

**Don't:**
- Use compliance jargon without explanation
- Write in formal "enterprise policy" voice
- Assume unlimited resources or dedicated teams
- Create false confidence with optimistic assumptions

If you're not sure whether your contribution fits the style, look at the existing template and blog post for reference.

## Sharing Examples

Real-world examples (properly anonymized) are incredibly valuable. If you'd like to share how you used this template:

1. **Remove all sensitive information** - Company names, specific systems, financial figures
2. **Focus on the approach** - What worked, what was hard, what you learned
3. **Submit via pull request** to the `/examples` directory (if we create one)
4. **Include context** - Industry, company size, what you were trying to accomplish

## Questions?

Not sure if something is appropriate to contribute? [Open an issue](../../issues) and ask. Better to check first than waste your time.

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in the README (unless you prefer to remain anonymous). Significant contributions might warrant a mention in blog posts about the template's development.

## Code of Conduct

**In short:** Be professional, be respectful, focus on the work.

We're all here to help SMBs manage risk better. Disagreements about approach are fine and expected. Personal attacks, promotional spam, and bad-faith arguments are not.
