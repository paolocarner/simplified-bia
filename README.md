# Business Impact Analysis Template for SMBs

A practical, no-nonsense Business Impact Analysis (BIA) template designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses. This template helps you understand which parts of your business are most critical and what happens when they stop working—without requiring enterprise-level resources or expertise.

## Why This Exists

Most BIA frameworks are written for enterprises with dedicated risk management teams, comprehensive vendor assessment programs, and unlimited consulting budgets. If you're running an SMB with limited resources, those frameworks feel overwhelming and impractical.

This template gives you a **"good enough"** approach that:
- Can be completed in 2-3 hours, not 2-3 months
- Uses plain language instead of compliance jargon
- Focuses on practical decisions over perfect documentation
- Helps you understand your real operational risks

## Who This Is For

- **SMB owners and managers** who need to understand their business continuity risks
- **IT teams** at small companies who need to prioritize recovery efforts
- **Organizations pursuing ISO 27001, NIS2, or DORA compliance** who need BIA documentation
- **Insurance buyers** who want to make informed decisions about business interruption coverage
- **Anyone dependent on vendors and cloud services** who needs to understand third-party risk

## What You Get

The template helps you document:

1. **Critical business processes** - What your business actually does that generates revenue
2. **Downtime tolerance** - How long each process can be down before serious damage occurs
3. **System dependencies** - Which technology, vendors, and services you depend on
4. **Recovery priorities** - What needs to come back online first when disaster strikes

## Quick Start

1. **Download the template:** [BIA_Template.md](BIA_Template.md)
2. **Gather the right people:** IT person, operations lead, and whoever runs key business processes
3. **Block 2-3 hours** for a focused discussion
4. **Fill it out together** - Don't overthink it, rough estimates are fine
5. **Review annually** or when major changes happen

## What This Enables

Once completed, your BIA helps you:

- **Respond faster to incidents** - You know what to fix first and why
- **Make smarter insurance decisions** - You can quantify business interruption exposure
- **Manage vendor risk** - You know which vendor relationships need the strongest contracts
- **Meet compliance requirements** - Supports ISO 27001, NIS2, DORA, and other frameworks
- **Justify security spending** - You can connect recovery capabilities to actual business impact

## Not Included (By Design)

This template intentionally **does not** include:

- Detailed financial impact calculations (unless you find them useful)
- Exhaustive vendor assessment questionnaires
- Complex dependency mapping tools
- Recovery procedure documentation (that's a different artifact)

Those things have their place in enterprise environments. For most SMBs, they're overkill.

## Philosophy

This template follows a few core principles:

**Good enough beats perfect.** You don't need precision down to the minute. You need enough information to make better decisions than you're making today.

**Business first, technology second.** Start with what your business does for customers, not what servers you run. Technology exists to support business processes, not the other way around.

**Honest over optimistic.** If you haven't tested your recovery process, your actual recovery time will be much longer than you think. Document reality, not aspirations.

**Living document, not shelf-ware.** A BIA that sits in a drawer and never gets updated creates false confidence. Build in regular review cycles.
